    "Association rule analysis attempts to find sets of informative patterns from large, sparse data sets.

    "- An *association* is simply the co-occurrence of two or more things.\n",
    "<br> Hot dogs might be positively associated with relish, hot dog buns, soda, potato chips, and ketchup.\n",
    "- A *set of items* is a group of one or more items, and might be written as {item1, item2, ...}. \n",
    "<br> For instance, a set might be {relish} or {hot dogs, soda, potato chips}.\n",
    "- A *transaction* is a set of items that co-occur in an observation. In marketing, a common transaction is the *market basket*, the set of things that are purchased or considered for purchase at one time.\n",
    "- A *rule* expresses the incidence across transactions of one set of items as a condition of another set of items.\n",
    "<br> The association of relish, conditional on hot dogs, is expressed in the rule {relish} ⇒ {hot dogs}.\n",

    "**Some metrics to understand for association rules**\n",

    "- The **support** for a set of items is the proportion of all transactions that contain the set.\n",
    "<br> If {hot dogs, soda} appears in 10 out of 200 transactions, then support ({hotdogs, soda}) = 0.05.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Confidence** is the support for the co-occurrence of all items in a rule, conditional on the support for the left hand set alone.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*} confidence(X ⇒ Y ) = \\frac {support (X ∩ Y )}{support(X)} \\end{equation*}\n",

    "If {relish} occurs in 1% of transactions (in other words, support ({relish}) = 0.01) and {relish, hot dogs} appears in 0.5%,\n",
    "then con f idence({relish} ⇒ {hotdogs}) = 0.005/0.1 = 0.5. In other words, hot dogs appear alongside relish 50% of the time that relish appears.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Lift** is the support of a set conditional on the joint support of each element.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}  lift (X ⇒ Y ) = \\frac {support (X ∩ Y )}{(support (X) * support (Y ))}\\end{equation*}\n",

    "Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.\n",

    "For large sets of data, there can be hundreds of items in hundreds of thousands transactions. The Apriori algorithm tries to extract rules for each possible combination of items. For instance, Lift can be calculated for item 1 and item 2, item 1 and item 3, item 1 and item 4 and then item 2 and item 3, item 2 and item 4 and then combinations of items e.g. item 1, item 2 and item 3; similarly item 1, item2, and item 4, and so on.\n",

    "As you can see from the above example, this process can be extremely slow due to the number of combinations. To speed up the process, we need to perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set a minimum value for support and confidence. This means that we are only interested in finding rules for the items that have certain default existence (e.g. support) and have a minimum value for co-occurrence with other items (e.g. confidence).\n",
    "- Extract all the subsets having higher value of support than minimum threshold.\n",
    "- Select all the rules from the subsets with confidence value higher than minimum threshold.\n",
