    "\n",
    "Cohort is a group of people who share similar characteristics.  \n",
    "Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics in which we group our users based on their common characteristics within a defined time-span to better track and understand their actions. In cohort analysis, we compare the behavior of customers or users over a period of time. Data can be obtained from a variety of sources such as ecommerce, product websites, mobile apps, business sales databases. We can then turn raw data into a valuable visualization that shows the current state of the business, product, or specific feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in conducting cohort analysis is to select a key indicator, a metric that will become the main tool of our research. Based on the purpose of the cohort analysis, we can use the retention rate, churn rate, product sales number, transactions, app install number, etc.     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohort analysis is a simple tool for identifying the most important and hidden problems in a product or business. For example, the number of users of a certain product never changes, and we take this information as a very good indicator of the state of the business. However, cohort analysis shows that every day there are a huge number of new users who sign up, start using the product within an hour, and then they churn. We now look at the same information from a different perspective and understand that we may need to improve user experience, product quality, market targeting, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of cohort analysis, we measure how many users stayed (engagement) instead of how many users came (growth) in a given time span.\n",
    "In short, cohort analysis helps us separate growth metrics from engagement metrics. \n",
